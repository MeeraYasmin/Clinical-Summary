John Doe, a 44-year-old male, presented to the hospital on November 20, 2024, with a 2-week history of epigastric discomfort, nausea, and occasional vomiting. The epigastric pain was described as a burning sensation, intermittent in nature, and typically exacerbated by meals, especially spicy or acidic foods. He reported some unintentional weight loss of approximately 8 pounds over the last month, although there was no mention of associated melena, hematemesis, or black stools, which might suggest gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient’s past medical history was significant for well-controlled hypertension and mild gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for which he had been using occasional antacids.

Upon admission, a thorough workup was initiated. Laboratory studies revealed a mild anemia, with a hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, but his liver function tests, renal function tests, and serum electrolytes were all within normal limits. A stool guaiac test was negative for occult blood, which was reassuring as the patient did not present with overt gastrointestinal bleeding. Given his clinical presentation and risk factors, an upper endoscopy was performed on November 21, 2024, which showed a 1.5 cm duodenal ulcer with surrounding erythema, suggesting an active ulcer. No perforation, obstruction, or malignancy was identified during the endoscopic examination.

The patient was diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease (PUD), likely caused by a Helicobacter pylori infection, as indicated by the positive serum H. pylori IgG test. Based on this, a treatment plan was established. The patient was started on pantoprazole 40 mg daily for acid suppression, aimed at reducing gastric acidity and promoting ulcer healing. He was also initiated on a standard H. pylori eradication regimen consisting of clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1 g twice daily for 14 days. In addition, iron supplements (ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily) were prescribed to address his mild anemia.

The patient was advised to follow a bland, low-acid diet, avoiding foods that could irritate the ulcer, such as spicy foods, alcohol, caffeine, and acidic beverages. He was also instructed to consume smaller, more frequent meals to minimize gastric irritation. He was encouraged to manage stress as part of his overall treatment plan, considering its potential impact on ulcer exacerbation.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient’s condition improved steadily. His pain began to subside within 48 hours of initiating proton pump inhibitor therapy, and he reported significant relief from nausea and discomfort. There were no signs of complications such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction. His blood pressure remained stable, with no changes necessary to his antihypertensive medications during the hospitalization.

The patient was discharged on November 28, 2024, in stable condition. He was instructed to continue taking pantoprazole 40 mg daily for 8 weeks, after which a gradual tapering of the dose may be considered, based on follow-up and clinical response. The complete 14-day course of antibiotics (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) was to be finished, and the iron supplementation was to continue to address his anemia. He was scheduled for a follow-up visit with gastroenterology in 2 weeks to assess the healing of the ulcer and to confirm eradication of H. pylori. He was advised to return to the emergency department if he developed any new severe abdominal pain, vomiting, melena, or hematemesis, which could be indicative of complications such as ulcer bleeding or perforation.

In terms of prognosis, the patient was informed that with adherence to the prescribed medications and dietary changes, he was likely to experience full recovery. However, he was also advised about the importance of stress management and lifestyle modifications in preventing future episodes of PUD.
