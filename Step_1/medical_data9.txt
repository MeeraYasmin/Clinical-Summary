Emily Carter, a 21-year-old female, presented to the dermatology clinic with concerns of persistent heavy dandruff, progressive hair thinning, and significant hair fall over the past year, accompanied by frequent acne breakouts on her face and neck. She described the hair loss as diffuse rather than patchy, with increased shedding noticeable during washing and brushing. She reported her scalp to be itchy and flaky, with areas of redness, particularly around the hairline and crown. Emily also noted that her acne had worsened in recent months, with painful, inflamed lesions on her cheeks, jawline, and neck, often leaving dark marks after healing. She denied any significant medical history or recent illnesses but mentioned irregular menstrual cycles, increased stress due to college, and frequent use of styling products and heat tools on her hair.

On examination, Emily exhibited diffuse thinning across the scalp with no clear bald patches, consistent with telogen effluvium, along with erythematous, flaky plaques characteristic of seborrheic dermatitis. Facial and neck acne included a mix of comedones, papules, pustules, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. There was no hirsutism or other signs of hyperandrogenism, and her body weight was within a healthy range. Basic laboratory tests, including thyroid function (TSH, T4) and iron studies, were ordered to rule out common underlying causes of hair loss, such as hypothyroidism or anemia. Additionally, hormonal panels, including testosterone and DHEAS, were requested due to her irregular cycles, to assess for potential polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Emily was diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, telogen effluvium secondary to stress and potential nutritional deficiencies, and moderate inflammatory acne. She was started on a medicated ketoconazole 2% shampoo to reduce scalp inflammation and flaking, with instructions to use it twice weekly for 4 weeks, alternating with a gentle sulfate-free shampoo. For her hair loss, she was prescribed a topical 2% minoxidil solution to stimulate regrowth and advised to incorporate biotin and zinc supplements into her diet. For her acne, she was started on a topical regimen of benzoyl peroxide 5% gel in the morning and a tretinoin 0.025% cream at night, with oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 3 months to address inflammation and prevent new lesions.

Emily was counseled on adopting a hair care routine that avoids harsh styling practices, excessive heat, and tight hairstyles that can exacerbate hair thinning. For her skin, she was instructed to avoid heavy makeup, maintain gentle cleansing twice daily, and use non-comedogenic moisturizers. Stress management strategies, including mindfulness exercises and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, were emphasized as part of her overall treatment plan.

Emily was discharged with a follow-up scheduled in 8 weeks to assess her response to treatment and review her lab results. She was advised to monitor for side effects such as scalp irritation or dryness and report any worsening of symptoms. With adherence to the prescribed therapies and lifestyle modifications, her prognosis for improved scalp and skin health is favorable. Further evaluation and adjustments to her treatment plan will depend on her response to therapy and the findings of her hormonal and nutritional assessments.
