Jessica Harper, a 31-year-old female, presented with concerns of persistent anxiety, frequent flashbacks, and sleep disturbances stemming from a traumatic event she experienced in her late teens. Over the past six months, she reported significant unintentional weight loss of approximately 20 pounds, bringing her BMI to 17.8, alongside episodes of fatigue, dizziness, and a diminished appetite. She expressed heightened body image concerns and disclosed a history of undergoing cosmetic procedures in her mid-20s, including rhinoplasty and lip augmentation, which she pursued to address lingering self-esteem issues. Her past medical history included mild depression and occasional use of benzodiazepines, though she had not been under regular mental health care. She denied substance use, though she admitted to skipping meals frequently and obsessively monitoring her calorie intake, exacerbated by heightened anxiety about her appearance.

On physical examination, Jessica appeared visibly frail and anxious. She had low muscle tone, thinning hair, and dry skin, which she attributed to her recent weight loss. Cardiovascular and neurological exams were normal, but she exhibited signs of orthostatic hypotension. Mental health evaluation revealed features consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including hypervigilance, emotional numbing, and avoidance behaviors. Initial lab results showed mild electrolyte imbalances, low albumin, and a vitamin D deficiency. Thyroid function and other major metabolic panels were normal, ruling out primary endocrine causes for her weight loss.

Jessica was diagnosed with PTSD complicated by disordered eating patterns and unhealthy weight loss. Her treatment plan included initiating sertraline 50 mg daily to help manage her PTSD symptoms and reduce anxiety, along with a referral to a trauma-focused therapist specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). A nutritional consultation was arranged to develop a balanced, calorically adequate meal plan aimed at stabilizing her weight and addressing her nutritional deficiencies. She was started on oral vitamin D supplementation and prescribed a mild appetite stimulant (cyproheptadine) to support her recovery.

Given her concerns about body image and the potential role of her past cosmetic procedures in shaping her current mental health, she was referred to a licensed counselor with expertise in body dysmorphia. Jessica was educated about the importance of self-compassion and resilience as part of her healing process and encouraged to avoid social media triggers that could exacerbate her insecurities. She was also advised to establish a consistent sleep routine and engage in light physical activity, such as yoga or walking, to help alleviate anxiety without contributing to further caloric deficit.

Jessica was discharged in stable condition with scheduled follow-ups in 2 weeks with both her primary care provider and her therapist to monitor her progress. She was given emergency contact information for crisis intervention services and advised to reach out immediately if she experienced worsening symptoms, including suicidal thoughts, extreme panic, or further weight loss. With adherence to her multidisciplinary care plan and a focus on addressing her PTSD, Jessica was reassured that she could achieve meaningful improvements in her mental and physical health over time.
