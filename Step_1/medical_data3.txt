Emily Carter, a 16-year-old female, was admitted for evaluation and surgical management of progressive thoracolumbar scoliosis, initially detected at age 12 during a routine school screening. She reported a gradual worsening of symptoms over the past year, including significant back pain exacerbated by prolonged standing or physical activity, as well as noticeable changes in her posture. Her parents also observed that her right shoulder appeared higher than her left and that her clothing no longer fit symmetrically. She denied any neurological symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in her extremities. Her past medical history was unremarkable, with no prior surgeries, chronic illnesses, or family history of scoliosis or other spinal deformities. She had reached menarche at age 13, and her Risser score of 3 indicated she was nearing skeletal maturity.

A detailed physical examination revealed a pronounced right thoracic rib hump on forward bending and a visible S-shaped curve in her spine. Standing scoliosis X-rays showed a right thoracic curve of 52 degrees (apex at T8) and a compensatory left lumbar curve of 38 degrees (apex at L3), consistent with idiopathic adolescent scoliosis. Pulmonary function testing showed no significant impairment, ruling out restrictive lung disease associated with severe scoliosis. Preoperative MRI was performed to evaluate for any intraspinal anomalies, and the results were normal, confirming idiopathic scoliosis as the diagnosis.

After thorough discussions with Emily and her family about the progression of her curves, potential complications, and treatment options, surgical correction was recommended. On November 22, 2024, Emily underwent posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation from T5 to L3. The surgical procedure aimed to correct the deformity, stabilize the spine, and prevent further progression. Intraoperative neuromonitoring was used to ensure the integrity of spinal cord function, and the procedure was completed without complications, achieving a correction of the thoracic curve to 12 degrees and the lumbar curve to 6 degrees. Blood loss was minimal, and no transfusions were required.

Postoperatively, Emily was transferred to the recovery unit and managed with a multimodal pain control regimen, including intravenous acetaminophen, ketorolac, and patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine, which was transitioned to oral oxycodone and acetaminophen by postoperative day 2. Physical therapy was initiated early, focusing on safe mobility techniques, including log-rolling and ambulation with assistance. By postoperative day 3, she was walking independently with minimal assistance. A thoracolumbar brace was fitted for additional support during the healing process. Follow-up X-rays showed excellent alignment and proper positioning of the pedicle screws and rods.

Emily was discharged on November 27, 2024, in stable condition. At discharge, she was provided with detailed postoperative care instructions, including wound care to keep the surgical site clean and dry, pain management with oral medications, and activity restrictions to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or twisting for the next 3 months. She was instructed to wear the thoracolumbar brace as directed and avoid strenuous activities until cleared by her surgeon. She was also given a prescription for outpatient physical therapy, which will begin 6 weeks post-surgery, focusing on core strengthening, posture correction, and gradual return to normal activities.

Emily and her family were educated on the warning signs of potential complications, such as fever, increased redness or swelling at the surgical site, drainage, severe pain unrelieved by medications, or any new neurological symptoms like numbness or weakness. She was advised to contact her care team immediately if any of these signs occurred. A follow-up visit was scheduled for 2 weeks post-discharge to assess wound healing and review her progress. Long-term follow-up visits at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year will include X-rays to monitor spinal alignment and hardware positioning.

Emily was counseled on resuming light, non-contact physical activities after 6 months and gradually returning to competitive sports after 9â€“12 months if cleared by her care team. Her prognosis is excellent, with significant improvement in spinal alignment, reduced back pain, and prevention of further curve progression. The surgical team emphasized the importance of adherence to follow-up appointments and physical therapy to ensure a successful recovery and optimal long-term outcomes.
