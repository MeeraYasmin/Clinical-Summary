Ethan Parker, a 5-year-old male, was admitted on November 20, 2024, with a persistent high-grade fever of 102–104°F for over 8 days, profound fatigue, pallor, and marked weakness that alarmed his parents. He had been experiencing difficulty staying awake, with decreased oral intake and noticeable weight loss over the past month. His parents also noted episodes of night sweats and occasional joint pain, though there were no reports of rashes, bleeding, or bruising. Initial examinations showed a frail, listless child with tachycardia (pulse 135 bpm) and mild hepatosplenomegaly but no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory results revealed anemia (hemoglobin 8.4 g/dL), thrombocytopenia, and elevated white blood cell counts (WBC 18,000/μL) with a left shift, alongside highly elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 68 mg/L, ESR 72 mm/hr).

Due to concerns about a possible hematologic malignancy such as leukemia, a bone marrow aspiration was attempted on November 21, 2024. However, during the procedure, the biopsy needle became lodged in the posterior iliac crest due to an equipment malfunction. Despite multiple attempts, the needle could not be safely removed at the bedside and required an emergent surgical intervention. The surgical team successfully removed the needle under general anesthesia, and intraoperative findings showed no damage to adjacent tissues. Postoperative imaging confirmed no structural complications, and the wound was clean, with minimal blood loss.

Further diagnostic workup, including blood cultures, chest X-ray, and abdominal ultrasound, showed no obvious source of infection or mass lesions. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV once daily) were initiated empirically, and antifungal coverage was added with fluconazole due to the prolonged fever and immunosuppressive-like profile. Viral panels for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and other pathogens were sent but returned negative. Preliminary bone marrow analysis showed a hypercellular marrow with no blasts, ruling out leukemia initially, though cytogenetics and flow cytometry studies remained pending.

In the days following surgery, Ethan’s fever showed a gradual decline, his appetite began to return, and his energy improved. By hospital day 6, his vital signs stabilized, and his parents reported that he was more alert and interactive. Nutritional support, including high-calorie, protein-rich snacks, was introduced to address his weight loss. A pediatric hematologist was consulted for follow-up and to oversee further investigations, including a repeat bone marrow aspiration if clinically indicated.

Ethan was discharged on November 28, 2024, in stable condition with strict follow-up instructions. His discharge medications included oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (45 mg/kg/day divided BID) for 7 days and acetaminophen for fever as needed. His parents were educated to monitor for any recurrence of fever, signs of infection, or unusual bruising, which might necessitate immediate medical attention. They were also advised to ensure good hydration and provide a balanced diet to support his recovery. Follow-up appointments with hematology and infectious disease specialists were scheduled within the next week to review pending lab results and determine the need for additional testing or treatment.

While the underlying cause of Ethan’s illness remains undetermined, his clinical improvement was reassuring, and his parents were encouraged to maintain close communication with the medical team. Further diagnostics, including advanced molecular testing, will be pursued to identify and manage any potential underlying conditions, with an emphasis on ruling out rare infectious, autoimmune, or hematologic diseases.
