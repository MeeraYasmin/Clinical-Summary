Michael Johnson, a 55-year-old male, presented to the clinic with concerns about poorly controlled blood pressure, elevated cholesterol levels, and recurrent lower back pain that has worsened over the past year. He reported a history of hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago and dyslipidemia identified 5 years ago, though he admitted to inconsistent medication adherence. His back pain, described as a dull, aching sensation localized to the lumbar region, was intermittent but exacerbated by prolonged sitting or lifting heavy objects. He denied any radiating pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in his legs. His medical history also included a borderline diagnosis of prediabetes, with no prior surgeries or major hospitalizations. He is a former smoker with a 20 pack-year history, having quit 7 years ago, and drinks alcohol occasionally. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father suffered a myocardial infarction at age 60.

On examination, Michael’s blood pressure was 154/92 mmHg, and his BMI was 28.2, classifying him as overweight. Cardiac and respiratory exams were unremarkable. Lumbar spine evaluation revealed mild tenderness to palpation but no deformities, and he had a full range of motion without neurological deficits. Lab results showed elevated LDL cholesterol at 165 mg/dL, low HDL cholesterol at 38 mg/dL, triglycerides at 210 mg/dL, and a fasting glucose of 112 mg/dL. Renal and liver function tests were normal. A plain lumbar X-ray revealed mild degenerative changes consistent with early osteoarthritis but no acute abnormalities or evidence of disc herniation.

Michael was diagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and mechanical lower back pain likely related to degenerative disc disease and poor core strength. His antihypertensive regimen was adjusted to include lisinopril 20 mg daily and amlodipine 5 mg daily for better blood pressure control. For his dyslipidemia, he was started on atorvastatin 20 mg daily and advised on dietary modifications, including a heart-healthy diet emphasizing low sodium, high fiber, and reduced saturated fats. He was encouraged to incorporate regular aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking or cycling, for at least 30 minutes, 5 days a week, and to lose 10–15 pounds to improve his overall cardiovascular health.

To address his back pain, Michael was prescribed a short course of NSAIDs (naproxen 500 mg twice daily as needed) and referred to physical therapy to improve lumbar flexibility and core strength. He was instructed to avoid heavy lifting and prolonged sitting without proper lumbar support. He was also advised to use a hot or cold pack for pain relief as necessary. A follow-up with orthopedics was recommended if his symptoms persisted or worsened.

Michael was discharged with comprehensive instructions on medication adherence, lifestyle changes, and the importance of routine follow-up. He was scheduled for a follow-up visit in 6 weeks to monitor his blood pressure, lipid profile, and glucose levels, as well as to assess his response to the back pain treatment plan. He was advised to return sooner if he experienced any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, leg weakness, or severe pain unresponsive to treatment. With commitment to his care plan, his prognosis is favorable, with the expectation of improved blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and quality of life.
