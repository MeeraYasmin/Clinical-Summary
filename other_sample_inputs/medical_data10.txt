Michael Grant, a 37-year-old male, was admitted to the emergency department on November 28, 2024, following a rattlesnake bite to his left ankle while hiking in a remote area. He presented approximately 45 minutes post-bite, reporting immediate intense pain at the site, progressive swelling, and a burning sensation radiating up his leg. Upon arrival, he displayed localized erythema, ecchymosis, and significant edema extending to the mid-calf. Systemic symptoms included mild tachycardia (pulse 105 bpm), nausea, and dizziness, though he remained hemodynamically stable without signs of severe envenomation such as coagulopathy or respiratory distress.

Michael’s initial workup included baseline labs, which revealed a slightly prolonged PT/INR (indicative of mild coagulopathy) and thrombocytopenia (platelets 110,000/μL). A venom detection assay confirmed envenomation by a rattlesnake species native to the region. He was promptly administered CroFab antivenom, receiving an initial bolus of 4 vials over 1 hour, followed by maintenance dosing to prevent recurrence of symptoms. Pain control was managed with IV morphine, and the affected limb was immobilized and kept elevated to reduce swelling. Serial monitoring of lab parameters, including coagulation profiles, hemoglobin levels, and electrolytes, was conducted every 6 hours during the first 24 hours of hospitalization.

Over the next 48 hours, Michael’s swelling and pain improved significantly, and there was no evidence of compartment syndrome or progressive systemic effects. Repeat labs showed normalization of platelet count and coagulation parameters. Wound care included gentle cleansing and application of a topical antibiotic ointment to prevent secondary infection, and he was started on a tetanus booster since his last vaccination was more than 5 years ago.

On discharge, Michael was provided with clear instructions to monitor for delayed serum sickness, a known side effect of antivenom therapy, which may present as fever, rash, or joint pain 7–21 days post-treatment. He was prescribed a 7-day course of oral cephalexin (500 mg twice daily) to cover for potential secondary wound infection and acetaminophen for residual pain. He was advised to avoid strenuous activities for at least 2 weeks to allow the tissue to heal and to keep the bite area clean and dry. Follow-up with his primary care physician was scheduled for one week to assess healing and review any additional lab work if needed.

Michael was educated on snake safety, including wearing protective footwear and remaining vigilant while hiking in snake-prone areas. He was reassured about his recovery, with an excellent prognosis given the timely administration of antivenom and lack of severe complications. He was instructed to return to the emergency department immediately if he experienced any signs of worsening swelling, fever, or unusual symptoms.
