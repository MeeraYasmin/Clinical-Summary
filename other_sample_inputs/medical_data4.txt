Sarah Miller, a 21-year-old female, presented to the clinic with concerns of excessive body and facial hair growth that she described as progressively worsening over the past 2 years. She reported coarse, dark hair on her upper lip, chin, chest, and lower abdomen, as well as irregular menstrual cycles, occurring every 2–3 months since menarche at age 14. She denied significant weight changes, acne, or deepening of her voice but expressed emotional distress about her appearance. Her medical history was notable for mild asthma managed with an albuterol inhaler as needed, and she had no family history of hirsutism, endocrine disorders, or early balding in female relatives.

On physical examination, Sarah’s BMI was 26.3, and she exhibited moderate hirsutism with a Ferriman-Gallwey score of 15, predominantly involving the face, chest, and lower abdomen. Mild acne was observed on her back and shoulders, but there were no signs of virilization, such as clitoromegaly or temporal hair recession. Blood pressure and other vital signs were within normal limits. Initial laboratory tests revealed elevated serum total testosterone at 85 ng/dL (normal < 50 ng/dL) and slightly elevated dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels, consistent with hyperandrogenism. FSH and LH levels were within normal ranges, but the LH-to-FSH ratio was slightly elevated, and fasting insulin levels were mildly increased, suggesting possible insulin resistance. A pelvic ultrasound revealed multiple small ovarian follicles bilaterally, supporting a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Other causes of hyperandrogenism, such as late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia, were ruled out with normal 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels.

Sarah was diagnosed with PCOS as the likely cause of her hirsutism and irregular periods. Treatment focused on managing her symptoms and addressing potential long-term risks such as metabolic syndrome and infertility. She was started on a combination oral contraceptive pill (ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone) to regulate her menstrual cycles, reduce androgen levels, and improve her skin. Additionally, she was prescribed spironolactone 100 mg daily as an anti-androgen to reduce hair growth over time. She was advised that visible improvement in hair growth might take 6–12 months. To address her mild insulin resistance, Sarah was encouraged to adopt lifestyle changes, including a low-glycemic-index diet, regular physical activity, and weight management. Metformin 500 mg twice daily was initiated to improve insulin sensitivity and support her overall metabolic health.

For cosmetic concerns, Sarah was referred to a dermatologist for hair removal options, including laser hair removal or electrolysis, and was educated about temporary measures like waxing and shaving. She was also referred to a mental health counselor to address her emotional distress and body image concerns. A follow-up appointment was scheduled in 3 months to reassess her symptoms, review her lab results, and adjust her treatment plan if necessary.

Sarah was discharged with detailed instructions about her medications, lifestyle recommendations, and the importance of adhering to follow-up care to monitor her response to treatment and manage any potential side effects. She was reassured about the prognosis, with an emphasis on the gradual nature of treatment outcomes for hirsutism and the importance of patience and consistency in achieving her goals.
