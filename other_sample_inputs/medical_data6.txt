Margaret Taylor, a 70-year-old female, was admitted for evaluation and management of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, chronic back pain due to osteoporosis, progressive dental decay, and worsening difficulty with ambulation over the past six months. She reported intermittent sharp lower back pain that radiated to her hips, exacerbated by standing or walking for more than 10 minutes, and had a history of multiple dental extractions over the past few years due to significant tooth decay. She also described increasing fatigue and unsteadiness while walking, requiring the use of a cane for support. Her medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes diagnosed 15 years ago, with recent A1C levels around 9.2%, and advanced osteoporosis diagnosed 3 years ago, with a history of vertebral compression fractures. She has been postmenopausal for over 20 years and does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her diet was noted to be low in calcium and protein, and she admitted to inconsistent use of prescribed medications due to financial constraints.

On examination, Margaret appeared frail, with a BMI of 21.3. She had noticeable kyphosis, tenderness over her lower thoracic and lumbar spine, and reduced range of motion. Neurological examination revealed normal strength in the lower extremities but a slow, unsteady gait. Oral examination showed extensive dental decay and several missing teeth, contributing to difficulty chewing. Lab tests revealed hyperglycemia with fasting blood glucose of 186 mg/dL and an A1C of 9.1%. Serum calcium and vitamin D levels were low, and bone density testing confirmed severe osteoporosis with a T-score of -3.2 at the lumbar spine. X-rays showed multiple old compression fractures at T12 and L2 but no acute fractures.

Margaret was diagnosed with poorly controlled diabetes, advanced osteoporosis with related complications, significant dental decay, and gait instability likely secondary to musculoskeletal and nutritional deficiencies. She was started on insulin glargine 10 units nightly, with a plan for titration, and continued on metformin 500 mg twice daily. A calcium supplement with vitamin D (calcium citrate 1200 mg daily with vitamin D3 2000 IU) was prescribed, along with zoledronic acid infusion to improve bone density. She was referred to a dentist for comprehensive dental care and was advised to focus on a soft, high-protein diet to address her chewing difficulties. To improve mobility and reduce fall risk, she was referred to physical therapy for gait training and core strengthening and was fitted for a walker to replace her cane. Pain management included acetaminophen as needed, avoiding NSAIDs due to her frailty and potential kidney risks.

Margaret was discharged on November 30, 2024, with clear instructions on managing her diabetes, including a glucose monitoring schedule and dietary recommendations to stabilize blood sugar levels. She was provided resources for financial assistance with her medications and connected with a nutritionist to help her incorporate more calcium-rich and balanced meals. Follow-up appointments were scheduled with endocrinology, orthopedics, and dentistry to monitor her conditions and ensure comprehensive care. She was advised to avoid heavy lifting, ensure proper footwear to reduce fall risks, and report any sudden worsening of back pain, new dental infections, or signs of hyper- or hypoglycemia immediately.

Despite her multiple health challenges, Margaret was reassured that with consistent adherence to her care plan, she could improve her quality of life and reduce complications. Her prognosis depends heavily on her ability to follow her treatment regimen and engage in follow-up care.
