Jane Smith, a 52-year-old female, presented to the hospital with a 3-month history of abnormal vaginal bleeding, primarily post-coital spotting, and intermittent pelvic pain radiating to her lower back. She also reported increased fatigue, occasional urinary frequency with mild dysuria, and unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over the past 6 months. Her menstrual history revealed irregular periods over the past year, which she attributed to approaching menopause. Jane’s past medical history included chronic hypertension, controlled with lisinopril, and a significant smoking history of 20 pack-years; she quit smoking 5 years ago. She denied any family history of gynecological cancers but noted a history of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection identified in a Pap smear 7 years ago, though she had not undergone routine follow-up screenings since then due to limited access to care.

On admission, a pelvic examination revealed a friable, ulcerated, irregular mass on the cervix, with contact bleeding noted during the exam. Further imaging with pelvic MRI showed a 4.5 cm cervical mass with involvement of the parametrium and partial encroachment on the left pelvic sidewall. No hydronephrosis was detected, and PET-CT ruled out distant metastases but revealed a slightly enlarged para-aortic lymph node, raising suspicion for regional lymphatic spread. Biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed with stage IIB cervical cancer under the FIGO staging system, with locally advanced disease but no evidence of systemic metastases.

Jane was promptly initiated on a treatment plan comprising concurrent chemoradiation therapy. She received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the pelvis over 5 weeks, delivering a total dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Weekly cisplatin infusions at a dose of 40 mg/m² were administered as a radiosensitizer. Following EBRT, she underwent brachytherapy with three high-dose-rate (HDR) sessions targeting the cervical tumor directly. She experienced mild treatment-related side effects, including nausea, fatigue, and transient diarrhea, all of which were managed with ondansetron, loperamide, and dietary modifications. Her complete blood count remained stable, with no significant anemia or neutropenia requiring intervention. Renal function was closely monitored due to the use of cisplatin and remained within normal limits throughout therapy.

During her hospital stay, Jane was educated extensively about her condition, the treatment plan, and potential side effects. She met with the hospital’s nutritionist to address her weight loss and was counseled on a high-protein diet to support recovery. Smoking cessation counseling was reinforced, emphasizing its importance in reducing the risk of recurrence and improving overall health outcomes. She was also referred to a psycho-oncology counselor and a local cancer support group for emotional and psychological support during her treatment journey.

Jane was discharged on November 30, 2024, in stable condition, with significant improvement in pelvic pain and a reduction in abnormal bleeding. She was provided with a detailed discharge plan, including instructions to follow up with her oncologist in 4 weeks for a post-treatment imaging assessment to evaluate the response to therapy and screen for residual disease. She was advised to remain vigilant for potential complications, such as fever, heavy vaginal bleeding, worsening pelvic pain, or urinary obstruction, and to seek immediate medical attention if these occurred. In addition, she was prescribed a course of vaginal dilators to prevent adhesions or stenosis as part of her post-radiation pelvic rehabilitation plan.

Her prognosis is cautiously optimistic, given the absence of distant metastases and the initiation of treatment within an optimal timeframe. She was informed about the importance of adherence to follow-up care, including periodic pelvic imaging, Pap smears, and HPV testing, to monitor for recurrence or new disease. The oncology team discussed long-term side effects, including the potential for radiation-induced changes to bowel or bladder function, and encouraged her to report any persistent symptoms during follow-up visits.
